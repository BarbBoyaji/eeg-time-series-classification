# eeg-time-series-classification

Combination_Model has the 3 layer CNN

RNN_CNN_Combination has an RNN followed by the same CNN architecture in Combination Model

LSTM_CNN_Combination has LSTM and CNN trained together and concatenated 

The objective here is the classify the action of a human subject, given 2115 trials of EEG time series data from 22 electrodes, from 9 different people. I'm attempting several as simple as possible architectures and evaluating which one performs best.
